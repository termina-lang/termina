* DONE Termina programs are imports + declarations

Parser + ParserAST
* TODO Analyze order.
** DONE First POC. Á la C
There is a main (root) file and we load files in demand.
** TODO Semantic Analyze each module
** TODO Project File. Á la all-modern-compilers.
There is a project file YAML,JSon or whatever, where there is a file noted as
main and then we do something similar to the previous approach.

* IDEA Lazy Read files first.
Optimization (I know, it smells like poop already). Open each file as stream and
before anything sort them, and after that, continue processing each file.
